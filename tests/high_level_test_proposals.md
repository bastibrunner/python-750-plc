# High-Level Testing Proposals for WAGO 750 Controller Library

This document outlines proposals for integration tests, functional tests, and other higher-level testing strategies to ensure the robustness of the WAGO 750 controller library.

## Integration Tests

### 1. End-to-End Communication Tests

- **Real Device Communication**

  - Test connecting to a real WAGO controller in a controlled test environment
  - Verify module discovery works correctly with actual hardware
  - Ensure correct reading and writing from various channel types on real hardware

- **Error Handling and Recovery**

  - Test behavior when connection is lost (e.g., network interruption)
  - Test automatic reconnection capabilities
  - Verify appropriate exceptions are raised and can be handled

- **Long-Running Stability Tests**
  - Run read/write operations for extended periods (hours or days)
  - Monitor for memory leaks, connection stability issues, or degraded performance

### 2. Configuration-Based Testing

- **Configuration Loading**

  - Test loading configurations from files (YAML/JSON)
  - Verify custom module aliases work correctly
  - Test module discovery with pre-configured modules vs. auto-discovery

- **State Change Monitoring**
  - Test monitoring state changes across multiple channels
  - Verify the order of state change notifications
  - Test race conditions in high-frequency state changes

## Performance Testing

### 1. Throughput Testing

- **Read/Write Speed**

  - Measure write operations per second for different channel types
  - Test performance with varying numbers of modules

- **Bulk Operations**
  - Test reading multiple channels in a single operation
  - Test writing to multiple channels in a single operation
  - Compare performance between individual and bulk operations

### 2. Resource Usage

- **Memory Usage**

  - Profile memory usage with different configurations
  - Test memory efficiency with large numbers of modules
  - Identify potential memory leaks under load

- **CPU Usage**
  - Measure CPU utilization during normal operation
  - Test CPU usage during heavy read/write operations
  - Profile CPU hotspots for optimization opportunities

## Security Testing

  - Test connecting with various authentication credentials
  - Verify unauthorized access is properly rejected
  - Test timeout and session handling

### 2. Input Validation

- **Boundary Testing**
  - Test input values at boundaries (min, max, overflow)
  - Verify invalid inputs are properly handled
  - Test robustness against unexpected data types

## Deployment Scenario Testing

### 1. Application Integration

- **Home Assistant Integration**

  - Test integration with Home Assistant automation platform
  - Verify entity discovery and control
  - Test reliability in home automation scenarios

- **Industrial Control Systems**
  - Test integration with SCADA systems

  - Verify operation with limited bandwidth
  - Test packet loss tolerance and recovery

## Implementation Approach

To implement these high-level tests:

1. **Create a Test Environment**

   - Set up a physical test bench with actual WAGO hardware for critical tests
   - Develop more sophisticated mock objects for simulating complex behaviors

2. **Develop Test Harnesses**

   - Create tools for automated test execution
   - Implement logging and reporting mechanisms for test results
   - Develop utilities for test setup and teardown

3. **Test Patterns**

   - Use parameterized tests for covering multiple scenarios
   - Implement test fixtures that handle real hardware connections
   - Create test factories for generating test configurations

4. **Continuous Integration**
   - Implement unit and mock-based tests in CI pipeline
   - Schedule periodic integration tests with real hardware
   - Set up performance benchmarking in controlled environments

## Priority Testing Areas

Based on the current codebase, the following areas should be prioritized for testing:

1. **Module Discovery and Configuration**

   - Thoroughly test the module discovery process
   - Verify module type detection and initialization
   - Test alias and custom configuration handling

2. **Channel Reading and Writing**
